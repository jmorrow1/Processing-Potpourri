# Processing-Potpourri
Assorted functions for Processing

Processing Potpourri is a collection of random functions that I've found myself writing over and over again and decided to put in one place.
It's written in .pde files because it's not really intended to be used like a proper Processing library.
It's more for copying and pasting functions into Processing sketches that need them.
Most of the functions are independent, and interdependent functions are always located in the same file.
